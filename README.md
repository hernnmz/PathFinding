# PathFinding
C# Windows Forms application 
Modified AndyBobBean's solution from URL https://github.com/AndyBobBean/PathFinding. To transform it into a mountain skier's longest route finder for 1000 * 1000 matrices. For this, a new class based on A Star was created, but with different heuristics oriented to taking the nodes of greater weight, where the weight is determined by height above sea level.
